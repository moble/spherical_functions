    This operator is defined in J. Math. Phys. 14, 874 (1973) <http://link.aip.org/link/?JMP/14/874/1>. The eth
    operator was originally defined by Newman and Penrose in J. Math. Phys. 7, 863 (1966)
    <http://link.aip.org/link/?JMP/7/863/1>, and discussed further by Goldberg et al., J. Math. Phys. 8, 2155 (1967)
    <http://link.aip.org/link/?JMP/8/2155/1>.  In the case of a spacelike 2-surface (which is all we treat in this
    function), the GHP eth operator reduces almost to the original.  By comparing GHP's Eq. (3.8) to Eq. (2.13) of
    Goldberg et al., we can see the difference.  As GHP say below their Eq. (3.11) that "for complete agreement in

    factor sqrt(2)."

    Parameters
    ----------
    modes : 1-d complex array

    ell_min : int, optional
        Smallest ell value present in input `modes`.  Defaults to 0.

    -------
    1-d complex array
        The output has the same size as the input `modes`, and corresponds to the same (ell,m) values.  Note, however,
        that these modes have spin weight greater than the input by 1.
