def complex_powers(z, M, zpowers=None):
    """Compute integer powers of z=exp(iθ) recursively

    This algorithm is due to Stoer and Bulirsch in "Introduction to Numerical Analysis" (page 24) —
    with a little help from de Moivre's formula, which is essentially exp(iθ)ⁿ = exp(inθ), as well
    as my own alterations to deal with different behaviors in different quadrants.

    There isn't usually a huge advantage to using this specialized function.  If you just need a
    particular power, it will generally be far more efficient and just as accurate to compute either
    exp(iθ)ⁿ or exp(inθ) explicitly.  However, if you need all powers from 0 to M, this function is
    about 10 or 5 times faster than those options, respectively.  Like those options, this function
    is numerically stable, in the sense that its errors are usually smaller than the error from
    machine-precision errors in the input argument — or at worst about 30% larger, around π/2.

    Parameters
    ==========
    z: complex
        Complex number to take integer powers of.  Note that this is assumed to be normalized, but
        can be an array of such numbers.
    M: int
        Highest power to compute
    zpowers: array of complex or None (defaults to None)
        If present, the output will be written into this array, which must have shape z.shape+(M+1,).
        Pre-allocating this argument can reduce the time spent in this function by up to 60%.

    Returns
    =======
    zpowers: array of complex
        Powers z⁰, z¹, ..., zᴹ.  The last dimension has size M+1, any preceding dimensions are the
        same as the input `z` array.
